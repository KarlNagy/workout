# Project Overview

## Problem:
* [Google Doc of workout records](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DT-zepXs5SBePTK3W15RSQ16GyuRmE6M_UZ2SNUMyVk/edit?usp=sharing) kept returning error messages and would not function on mobile
* Data has not been tracked in tabular format for analysis

## Proposed solution:
* transfer existing records to MySQL database format
* build web entry form usable on mobile using Python/Flask
* connect Excel sheet to data and perform analysis with dashboard features

## Steps:
1. Design database EER in MySQL
2. Convert raw data of google doc to excel sheet
3. Analyse data in excel
